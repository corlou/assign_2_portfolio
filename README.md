# Understand Flex-Box

- display: flex = Defines a flex container
- flex-direction = which way I want the content to go (left, right, up, down)
- flex-wrap = allows items to wrap onto the next line as needed

# Background vs. Image

In the Projects page, I used a background image for the card container. I will admit that while it feels slighty unconventional to use images in this way, I found it uses less HTML and CSS to achieve the same result. I have demonstrated the ability to use images using the img tag in the "About Me" page so this was more of an experiment of what else can be done with images.
