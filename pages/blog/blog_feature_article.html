      <p>
        Brief: A staff portal was developed by Danitt before I joined the team.
        It was a way for Ride It Right to manage their motorcycle fleet of over
        150 bikes at 6 different training centres along the East Coast. It was
        also a way for staff to communicate and check their roster. RIR was in
        the process of upgrading the system but they closed due to unforseen
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new contract was established with Stay Upright. They needed a few
        modifications to the Portal and the addition of their branding. I took
        over the new designs and client communications. Together, we came up
        with new features that further enhanced their business. Furthermore, I
        occassionally fly to their head office in Sydney for staff training on
        how to use the Portal and discuss possible new features. I also created
        staff training videos for the ocassional new staff member.
